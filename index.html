            Transcription factors and target genes: 
              <ul>
                  <li>
                    Gene A: TF (transcription factor)

                    Gene B: Target gene whose promoter contains TF binding sites 
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Regulatory mechanism: TF binds to specific DNA sequences within the promoter of gene B, recruiting RNA polymerase and other factors that activate transcription. This leads to increased mRNA and protein production of gene B. 
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Functional significance: This is a fundamental mechanism in gene regulation, enabling cells to respond to external stimuli or internal signals by selectively turning different genes on. Numerous examples exist, like MYOD promoting muscle-specific gene expression during myogenesis.

                    Gene B: TF and its target gene 
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Regulatory mechanism: Coactivators physically interact with TFs and assist them in binding to DNA, stabilizing their interaction, and recruiting other components of the transcriptional machinery. This significantly enhances the TF's ability to activate gene expression, effectively boosting the output of gene B. 
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Functional significance: Coactivators can play crucial roles in specific biological processes by fine-tuning TF activity and ensuring precise control over gene expression. For instance, MED1, a coactivator, is essential for estrogen receptor-mediated gene expression in breast cancer.

                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Regulatory mechanism: Viral transactivators bind to specific DNA sequences within the promoter of host genes, hijacking the cellular transcription machinery to drive expression of genes that benefit the virus, like those involved in replication or immune evasion. 
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Functional significance: This mechanism illustrates how viruses can manipulate host gene expression to their advantage, contributing to viral pathogenesis. HIV Tat protein is a classic example, activating several host genes involved in viral transcription and replication.
